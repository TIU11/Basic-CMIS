## Description

Wordpress Plugin for basic CMIS integration. Searches a CMIS compliant system and renders the matching documents. Tested with Alfresco Enterprise's CMIS service, but should work with any [CMIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services)  compatible source (e.g. Microsoft Sharepoint, Alfresco).

## Installation

1. Pull down the code from Github.
2. Create a `basic-cmis` folder under your Wordpress plugins folder.
3. Upload the code to the new folder.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Configure the plugin via the Admin panel. You must provide a CMIS url, username and password. This is used sitewide.
6. Use the `cmis` shortcode in your content.

## Usage

Use the `[cmis]` shortcode to retrieve documents and render them.
* Docs in a folder: `[cmis folder="/my particular/folder name/"]`
* Docs in the folder, including subfolders: `[cmis tree="/my particular/folder name/"]`
* Docs containing the keywords: `[cmis keywords="coffee tea"]`
* Docs whose name matches. May include wildcard character '%': `[cmis name="Agenda%.doc"]`
* Combinations of parameters: `[cmis folder="/documents" keywords="bacon" name="%menu%.pdf"]`

## Todo

* Display options:
  `[cmis display_options="show_icon show_modified_date hide_title"`
* Render a suitable title:
  * `[cmis folder="/My Documents"]` => "Documents in /My Documents"
  * `[cmis tree="/My Documents"]` => "Documents in /My Documents"
  * `[cmis keywords="coffee"]` => "Documents containing 'coffee'"
  * `[cmis name="%Agenda%"]` => "Documents named '%Agenda%'"
